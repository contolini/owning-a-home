Feature: verify the Loan Comparison page works according to requirements
  As a first time visitor to the Owning a Home page
  I want to navigate the Loan Comparison page
  So that I can find the information I'm looking for

Scenario: First time visitor should see landing page by default
  Given I navigate to the "Loan Comparison" page
  #Then I should see the lender rate offered to "Alabama" residents
