      <h2>A worksheet for first-time homebuyers</h2>

      <p class="lead">For many Americans, buying a home can be a great decision. But homeownership isn't for everyone at all times. This worksheet was designed by the CFPB to help you think through your reasons for wanting to buy a home, and to help you evaluate the financial and lifestyle tradeoffs to decide whether now is the right time to buy.</p>
